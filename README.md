# GRN Analysis Pipeline

A web-based interactive report for **Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) reconstruction** from bulk RNA-seq data. This project showcases the results of an R-based workflow including preprocessing, differential expression analysis, and GRN inference—delivered as a clean, browsable webpage.

## 🌐 Live Report

📖 **Explore the analysis at:**  
👉 [https://woosflex.github.io/grn_analysis](https://woosflex.github.io/grn_analysis)

This webpage includes:
- Overview of the analysis pipeline
- Preprocessing and QC results
- Differentially expressed genes
- Inferred gene regulatory networks
- Network statistics and visualizations

## 🧰 Tools & Methods Used

- **R** for analysis and report generation
- `edgeR`, `limma`, or `DESeq2` for differential expression
- `igraph`, `WGCNA`, or custom correlation methods for GRN inference
- `rmarkdown` / `quarto` for converting the R-based workflow to HTML
- Hosted using **GitHub Pages**


## 💡 About

This project is part of my academic and personal effort to explore **network biology** using publicly available RNA-seq data. It combines scripting, statistical analysis, and visualization for a complete mini-pipeline.
